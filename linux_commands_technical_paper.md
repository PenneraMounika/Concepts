# Technical Paper: Understanding `find`, `rsync`, and `ps` Commands in Linux

## Introduction

Linux provides a powerful command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. Among various available commands, `find`, `rsync`, and `ps` are fundamental for file search, synchronization, and process monitoring respectively. This document explains each command with syntax, common use cases, and practical examples.

## 1. `find` Command

### Purpose:
It s used to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy.

### Syntax:
```bash
find [path] [options] [expression]
```

### Common Options:
- `-name`: Search by filename
- `-type`: Filter by file type (`f` for file, `d` for directory)
- `-size`: Find files by size
- `-mtime`: Filter by modification time
- `-exec`: Execute a command on the matched files

### Examples:
```bash
find /home/user -name "*.txt" -> To find a file , whose name ends with .txt
find . -type f -size +10M     -> Find files larger than 10MB
find . -type f -name "*.log"  -> find files whose name ends with .log
```

## 2. `rsync` Command

### Purpose:
rsync stands for `Remote Synchronization`. It efficiently sync files and directories between two locations.

### Syntax:
```bash
rsync [options] source destination
```

### Common Options:
- `-a`: Archive mode (recursive, preserves permissions, etc.)
- `-v`: Verbose output (shows detailed output during execution)
- `-z`: Compress file data during the transfer
- `--delete`: Delete files in the destination that are not in the source
- `-e ssh`: Use SSH for remote transfers

### Examples:
```bash
rsync -avz /home/user/Documents/ /backup/Documents/     ->sync a local directory to another
rsync -avz -e ssh /var/www user@remote:/var/www_backup  ->sync with the remote server over ssh
rsync -av --delete source/ dest/                        ->mirroring a directory
```
## 3. `ps` Command

### Purpose:
ps stands for `Process State`. It displays information about active processes.

### Syntax:
```bash
ps [options]
```

### Common Options:
- `aux`: Show all processes with detailed information
- `-ef`: Display full-format listing
- `-u [user]`: Show processes for a specific user
- `--sort`: Sort output by a given column (e.g., `--sort=-%mem` for memory usage)

### Examples:
```bash
ps aux
ps -ef | grep apache
ps -u root
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10
```

## Conclusion

Learning the `find`, `rsync`, and `ps` commands makes working with linux easier and helps solve problems faster.
